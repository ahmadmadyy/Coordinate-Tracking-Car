# Coordinate-Tracking-Car
An AVR-controlled Arduino car that takes as input x and y coordinates from a keypad and uses an encoder sensor with PID Control and PWM to reach its destination.

## Software Design
The software design folder contains the 2 files, an Arduino file that has 2 codes the normal project code and another implemented with FreeRTOS. The second file contains the SIMULINK simulation file and PID controller design.

## Hardware Design 
This folder includes all the Solidworks files and libraries used to design the hardware used.

### Other folders include the images and videos of the project, circuit design and simulation, and the PDF report of the project.
